    "# Mattergen & CHGNet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mattergen** is a generative AI model developed by Microsoft Research for materials discovery. It is trained on vast crystallographic databases to generate novel, theoretically stable crystal structures from scratch, significantly expanding the search space for new materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHGNet** (Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network) is a universal graph neural network potential. It predicts the energy, forces, and stresses of atomic structures with high efficiency and accuracy comparable to density functional theory (DFT), enabling rapid structural relaxation and property evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combined Workflow**\n",
    "This methodology integrates the strengths of both tools into a powerful, automated pipeline. **Mattergen** acts as the *generator*, creating a diverse pool of candidate structures. These candidates are then passed to **CHGNet**, which serves as the *evaluator* and *refiner*, performing fast and accurate structural relaxation and energy ranking. This synergistic approach enables high-throughput screening for stable, promising materials, accelerating the discovery process beyond traditional methods."
