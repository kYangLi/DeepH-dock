    "# ABACUS Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The ABACUS Interface module facilitates the conversion of **[ABACUS](https://abacus.ustc.edu.cn)** (Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC) calculation outputs into the DeepH DFT data format. ABACUS is a modern, high-performance, open-source DFT package renowned for its **computational efficiency and pioneering design for AI-driven research workflows**. Developed at the Peking University, it represents a new generation of electronic structure codes that natively embraces both high-performance computing and machine learning paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strength of ABACUS lies in its **dual-basis-set** architecture, which seamlessly supports both plane-wave and numerical atomic orbital (NAO) bases within the same framework, coupled with various pseudopotentials. This flexibility allows researchers to choose the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency for different materials systems. Furthermore, ABACUS is engineered from the ground up with **exceptional parallel scalability and low memory footprint**, making it exceptionally capable for large-scale simulations—a perfect source for generating the extensive, high-quality training data required by DeepH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond raw performance, ABACUS is at the forefront of the **AI for Science** movement. Its modular, data-aware architecture facilitates seamless integration with machine learning pipelines, making it an ideal partner for DeepH. The Hamiltonian and overlap matrices produced by ABACUS's NAO mode are intrinsically compatible with DeepH's localized orbital representation, ensuring a theoretically coherent and efficient data conversion process. By bridging ABACUS's efficient, large-scale DFT engine with DeepH's neural network models, this interface unlocks a powerful synergy: the rapid generation of precise training data meets scalable, ultra-fast property prediction, dramatically accelerating the cycle of computational materials discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conversion module empowers researchers to leverage the growing ecosystem of ABACUS datasets, harnessing their inherent compatibility with AI workflows to train robust DeepH models for accelerated electronic structure calculations while maintaining rigorous first-principles accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The current interface is developed for ABACUS version 3.10 LTS. Please note that output file structures may differ in other versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing ABACUS Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required ABACUS Settings\n",
    "To obtain the raw data required by DeepH-pack (Hamiltonian, overlap matrix, etc.) from ABACUS calculations, you must configure your ABACUS input files appropriately. The following settings are essential in the `INPUT` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "basis_type     lcao      # Required: Use atomic orbital basis\n",
    "out_mat_hs2    1         # Required: Enable sparse matrix output for Hamiltonian and Overlap\n",
    "calculation    scf       # Optional: Default is 'scf', use 'get_S' for overlap matrix only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For inference process which only needs the overlap matrix, the option `calculation get_S` should be used and the program will exit after dumping the `SR.csr` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Considerations for ABACUS Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Atomic Species Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "ABACUS allows different settings for the atoms of the same element (e.g., different basis sets and pseudopotentials for bulk and surface silicon atoms), but `DeepH-pack` can not distinguish these differences and treats them as the same species. To avoid this problem, the species labels in the `ATOMIC_SPECIES` block should be the standard element symbols instead of user-defined symbols (e.g., only `Si` is allowed for silicon atoms and `\"Si1\"` is not allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Structure Organization\n",
    "Assuming you have already read the ABACUS [documentation](https://abacus.deepmodeling.com/en/latest/index.html) and are familiar with conducting DFT calculations using ABACUS, to prepare your ABACUS data for DeepH training, you must organize the data for different material structures according to the following convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ABACUS Data Structure\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "abacus_datasets/\n",
    "├── structure_1/\n",
    "│   └── OUT.{suffix}/\n",

    "│       └── ...\n",
    "└── ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `structure_1`, `structure_2`, etc., represent the names of individual datasets and can be any combination of characters. Structure information is stored in the `running_*.log` file and physical properties are stored in the `data-*.csr` files, all of which are dumped under `OUT.{suffix}` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DeepH-dock data conversion tool will automatically transform this organized data into the format recognized by DeepH-pack. It will be converted into the DeepH format like:\n",
