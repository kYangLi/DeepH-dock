    "# HopCP Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The HopCP Interface is a conversion utility that transforms DeepH-format Hamiltonian data into the **[PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/)** (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) binary format. This format is designed for use with [**HopCP**](https://github.com/kYangLi/HopCP), a library developed by the DeepH team for processing ultra-large-scale sparse Hamiltonians, and is fully open-sourced now. PETSc is a powerful suite of data structures and routines for scalable scientific computations, particularly useful for large-scale sparse matrix operations in quantum chemistry and materials science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DeepH & HopCP Ecosystem\n",
    "One of DeepH's key innovations is its ability to predict Hamiltonians for ultra-large-scale structures through training on smaller configurations—scaling physical insights from nano to macro scales. However, obtaining the Hamiltonian is only the first step; transforming these quantum mechanical descriptions into practical material properties requires specialized computational tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "HopCP was developed to address precisely this need. As a successor to the [HopTB](https://github.com/HopTB/HopTB.jl) software package, HopCP leverages C++ with [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/) and [SLEPc](https://slepc.upv.es/release/) libraries to provide high-performance computational capabilities for processing ultra-large sparse Hamiltonians. This complete re-engineering enables efficient calculations of electronic, optical, and response properties at unprecedented scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PETSc?\n",
    "PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) provides:\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Efficient parallel processing for distributed-memory systems\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Comprehensive linear algebra and eigenvalue solvers\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with various scientific computing workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing PETSc\n",
    "\n",
    "To install PETSc with the appropriate configuration for HopCP, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dock convert hopcp how-to-install-petsc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command generates a customized installation template with optimal settings for Hamiltonian computations. The template includes:\n",
    "- Recommended compilation flags for maximum performance\n",
    "- Required dependency configurations\n",
    "- Platform-specific optimization settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Example output:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "[done] PETSc installation template created successfully!\n",
    "Created: ./PETSc\n",
    "Review the template and run: make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
