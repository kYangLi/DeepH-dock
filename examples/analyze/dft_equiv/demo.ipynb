    "# Data Equivariance\n",
    "\n",
    "The networks implemented in DeepH-pack are equivariant networks, which strictly follow the piror knowledge that the physical properties transform equivariantly under spatial translations and rotations. On the other hand, the data (e.g., Hamiltonians and density matrices) generated by the DFT programs may slightly break the equivariance rule because of the discrete mesh in the real space. Obviously, the equivariance error is part of the unphysical noise of the training data, which is the lower bound of the train loss of the neural network. So that to properly train and evaluate a DeepH model, it is crucial to keep the equivariance error of the data below the expression error of the model. DeepH-dock provides a tool chain to systematically test the data equivariance."

    "Be careful of the `rot-mode` argument. Mode 0 denotes no rotation and is used for translational equiviance test. For periodic systems, only mode 3 is allowed for rotational equiviance test. For cluster systems with regular real space mesh (e.g., OpenMX, SIESTA, etc), only mode 1 and 2 are meaningful for rotational equiviance test.
