    "Here $i,j$ label atoms, $\\alpha,\\beta$ label orbitals on those atoms, $\\boldsymbol{R}_i,\\boldsymbol{R}_j$ are lattice translation vectors to the unit cells containing atoms $i,j$, and $\\mathcal{R}_i,\\mathcal{R}_j$ are their positions within the unit cell. When SOC is present, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ have an additional spin degree of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ```DeepH-dock```, overlaps are computed using the efficient grid-based interpolation scheme used in the [HPRO package](https://github.com/Xiaoxun-Gong/HPRO/), which was originally proposed by [Sankey and Niklewski](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.40.3979).\n",
